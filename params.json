Timecodes can be created from a number representing the frame count or a string in the form \"hh:mm:ss:ff\".  Drop-frame is not working yet.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n    var timecode = require(\"timecode\").Timecode;\r\n\r\n    var tc1 = timecode.init({framerate: \"29.97\", timecode: \"01:00:00:00\"});\r\n    var tc2 = timecode.init({framerate: \"23.98\", timecode: \"01:00:00:00\"});\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n    $ npm install -g nodeunit\r\n\r\n    $ nodeunit test\r\n"}
